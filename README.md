# GeneralUser-GS

GeneralUser GS is a Roland GS and General MIDI (GM) compatible SoundFont bank for composing, playing MIDI files, and retro gaming. It features 261 instrument presets and 13 drum kits, all while possessing a very low memory footprint (30.7 MB of RAM). GeneralUser GS features detailed instrument programming, making heavy use of SoundFont synthesis and modulator features. This can help it sound as good or better than SoundFonts 2-3 times its size but also makes GeneralUser GS more dependent on having a standards-compliant synth for proper playback of its instruments.
